A chatting app implemented using C - Programming Language by using TCP-Socket programming. In this project multiple Client can send and receive message between each other until they are connected to the Server.
Clients can use multiple commands and command format provided by the server to communicate with the server and other actively connected clients via server.

```bash
  sudo apt update
```

Install GCC compiler

```bash
  sudo apt-get install gcc -y
```

Check GCC version

```bash
  gcc --version
```

## Compile & Run the code

First compile Server.c and Client.c as server and client
